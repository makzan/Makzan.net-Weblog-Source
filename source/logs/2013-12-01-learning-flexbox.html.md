I have kept an eye on CSS flexbox for months, or years, since its first drafts. The syntax has been changing. Recently the syntax seems to be more stable and I think it is time to really learn how to use it.

Here is a sketch note on learing the positioning of flexbox.

I will add the the note for flexbox sizing here later.
