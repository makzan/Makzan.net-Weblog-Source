> “Web experiences should respond to multiple contexts so that they’re meaningful to every reader, in every moment, on every device.”

From [The next big thing in responsive design.][1]

Makzan.net should respond not only to the screen size, but also respond to the readers. 

For example, it may show “Welcome back” for returning readers. It may store where the readers stop last time and provide a link to continue reading at home page. It may recommend related course at the bottom of the page. It may recommend a different learning path inside the same course according to the reader’s reading habit.

Anyway, I agree with the post that web design should be responsive to the context, instead of the screen size.
