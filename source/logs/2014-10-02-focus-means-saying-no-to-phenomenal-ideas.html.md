From [MacRumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/09/jony-ive-interview-iphone-6/):

> Jonathan Ive also shared details on Steve Jobs, saying that Jobs was “the most remarkably focused person” he’d ever met in his life. “You can achieve so much when you truly focus,” Ive said. “What focus means is saying no to something that with every bone in your body you think is a phenomenal idea. And you wake up thinking about it, but you say no to it because you’re focusing on something else.”

I believe focus is the key to archive great things. I really need to learn to say *No* to my every day new ideas in order to focus on the current task until it is great and polish.
