This is a simple tricks but very useful if youâ€™re trying to make a button in HTML looks like a real button in touch devices.

Remove the tap highlight:

```css
-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0,0,0,0);
```

and make the `:active` state works when user touches that element:

```css
document.addEventListener("touchstart", function(){}, true);
```
