We can start using flexbox nowadays. If you have not started exploring this new layout feature, the “[Using flexbox today][782]” is a quick-start guide.

Flexbox is not just a replacement of the `float`. Flexbox can actually solve the layout problems that we face by using the current CSS technologies. The website “[Solved by Flexbox][783]” shows how flexbox archive layouts in an elegant way.

I wrote a [cheatsheet of flexbox][784] for quick reference to help you get started.

Note: Do you know that float was originally designed for image to be wrapped by text. It’s not designed for layout.
