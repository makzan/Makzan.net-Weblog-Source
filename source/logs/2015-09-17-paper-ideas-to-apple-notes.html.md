Paper is for sticky notes. It’s the idea that I don’t know how it forms and improves. I can freely draw and type my ideas. And I can reordering them easily until the idea makes sense to me. Once the idea makes sense, I move it away into other editing tools, such as Apple Notes where I start turning my pieces of information into document.
