[Paper] is for sticky notes. It’s the idea that I don’t know how it forms and improves. I can freely draw and type my ideas. And I can reorder them easily until the idea makes sense to me. Once the idea makes sense, I move it away into other editing tools. For example, I use Apple Notes to turn my pieces of information into a document. Or use [Ulysses] to complete the long form writing.
