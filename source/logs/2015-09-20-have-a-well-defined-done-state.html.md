Productivity is not about doing things faster. It’s about thinking and planning better. If things are well planned, it won’t take much time to complete a task. I meant it does take time, but it is a limited time if the goal is clear. But if things are not well planned, the tasks you perform may be irrelevant. Irrelevant means you are working in the wrong direction and thus wasting the time instead of contributing to the goal.

Productivity increases when you define what is the done state and plan on now to archive that state.
