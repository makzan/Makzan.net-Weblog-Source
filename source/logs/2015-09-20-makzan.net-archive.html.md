I have archived the old makzan.net into [archive.makzan.net]. I have kept the 4 courses URL unchanged. They are:

- [Mobile web app development][1]
- [Ruby on Rails 101][2]
- [Introducing Web Design][3]
- [Mobile Web Design][4]


Refering to my [beta announcement][5], these courses will have a dedicated site. Meanwhile, I just host the as-is version here to keep the URL works.
