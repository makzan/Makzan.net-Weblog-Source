Link: [I’m Returning to Single-Tasking][1]


I’ve been a fan of Leo Babauta. I gave out [his book][2] to my friends as Christmas gifts.

I just realise that I share similar single task strategy that he uses:

> 1. One browser tab open. 
> 2. Know what I’m focusing on. 
> 3. Read to completion. 
> 4. One app on my phone at a time. 
> 5. Be mindful of interruptions & switching. 
> 6. Consciously close my computer & phone.

Especially now I aware more when I can get focus and when I got distracted, because [growing a baby][3] is really time/energy consuming.
