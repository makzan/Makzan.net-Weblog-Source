I wrote a half-done book, {3}[Practical CreateJS], in early 2015.

Iâ€™m exploring a new approach to write my book in link:/tags/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc]. I restart the writing process of the Practical CreateJS book and used a weekend to convert the book from Markua into AsciiDoc. I open source {1}[the book source] and you can {2}[read the book online] in the following URL:

If you want to support the book writing, or if you find my tutorials useful, please consider buying the book on {3}[LeanPub].
