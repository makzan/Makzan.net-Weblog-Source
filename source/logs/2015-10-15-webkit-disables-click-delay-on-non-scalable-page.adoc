When a viewport is unscalable (specified through the meta viewport tag) we do not add a delay to our single tap gesture recognizer.

When we set the viewport to unscalable, which means we want that web page acts like an app. So we shoudnâ€™t make our web page unscalable just for the sake to disable the click delay.

By the way, I mentioned about http://www.makzan.net/mobile-web-app-dev-with-phonegap/touchstart-and-touchend-event/[disabling the click delay by using touch event] in my mobile web app course.
