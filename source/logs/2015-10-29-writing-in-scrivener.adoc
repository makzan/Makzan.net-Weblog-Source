I purchased the writing application {3}[Scrivener] for years. But I didn’t really get used to it. I switched to use others writing apps, namely Editorial, iA Writer, Ulysses.

Recently I’m exploring the workflow to {1}[write my books and blog posts in AsciiDoc format], which is in plain text that gives me much more control than Markdown. I was trying to {2}[use Textastic on iOS] and Atom on Mac to write all the AsciiDoc documents, mainly because they give me preview of the document.

Then, I found an issue. I don’t write as much as I were using Ulysses. Then I inspected and found out the reason. The unified library in Ulysses allows me to write down anything first without creating any files. Whenever I want to write, I just create a new note and write down the text. When I finished, I move the note to existing folders, or move to inbox if I haven’t categorized it.

In Atom, or Textastic, whenever I want to write, I need to create a new file, give the file a name, and then write. For any existing files, they hide in somewhere in the file system. I have to open them in the file system. They are not easily reachable and waiting for me to write. They are invisible and I easily forget about them.

Yesterday I downloaded and installed Scrivener again. I create one, and only one, project named “All My Writings” in a dropbox folder. I use folders to organize all my writings. They may be books, blog posts, writings without categories. Now all of my writings are in the sidebar again, just like Ulysses. I don’t need to find them inside my huge amount of files and folders. Every day I have the Scrivener application launched, I have access to all of my current writings.

I also setup the Scrivener to work with plain text. I use a fixed width font face. Turn off the format bar and rulers. I mark my document as “Compile As-Is” to output my AsciiDoc format. More on how I configure Scrivener later.
