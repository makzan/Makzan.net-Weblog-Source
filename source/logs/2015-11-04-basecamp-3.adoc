I have been a fans of both the Basecamp product and the company behind it, formly http://37signals.com[37signals] and now https://basecamp.com[Basecamp].

I clipped an interview to Jason Fried by http://www.offscreenmag.com/issue12/[OffScreen Magazine]:

> We thought long about what it’d be like to concentrate on one product forever. We realised, through, that it’s not really _one_ product forever. It may be one product _name_ forever, but the actual product will evolve in all sorts of ways over the years.
